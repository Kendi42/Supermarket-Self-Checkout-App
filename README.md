# Supermarket-Self-Checkout-App
This is a mobile application that allows users to self checkout at a supermarket. This is done by scanning the shopping items with the scanner on the app, and eventually paying for the scanned items using M-Pesa. This application was created to combat long queues in supermarkets and give users alternative checkout options.
